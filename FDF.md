A 42 project in which we have to read a map file (with a format similar to ArcGrid) and show it using isometric projection.

To compile the program
```bash
$ make
```

To load a map (there are a few examples on test_maps folder)
```bash
$ ./fdf map.fdf
```


## Interface

Controls can be displayed when your mouse hoover over the blue sphere at the bottom right corner.

Maps can be displayed using polar coordinates (at the time this feature can only be used by changing o few lines of code)
